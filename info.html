                <h2>Throughout the season, I will post updates to twitter and vods to youtube</h2>
                <h2>Basics:</h2>
                <p>This is a weekly event starting on May 30th. You will receive points every week based on how you
                    place,
                    so make sure to show up as much as you can and try your hardest!</p><br>
                <p>There are 2 brackets each week, but only the singles bracket will count for points. The special
                    bracket is just for fun.</p>
                <p>At the end of the season, there will be a playoffs bracket to finish the season. This will be seeded
                    based on your ranking. In the playoffs bracket half of the league participants will start in winners
                    side and the other half will start in losers side. This provides a reason to try your hardest during
                    the season, as only participants that rank in the top half will start in winners side.</p>
                <h2>PLAYOFFS BRACKET ELIGIBILITY:</h2>
                <h4>To be eligible to participate in the playoffs bracket you must participate for at least 4 weeks of
                    the league. This is so people who didnt participate for at least 4 weeks can not just come in at the
                    end to farm out the reward.</h4>
                <p>During the regular season all matches will be best of 3 until top 3 in the bracket. That means
                    winners finals, losers finals, and grand finals will all be best of 5.</p>
                <p>During the playoffs bracket all sets will be best of 5.</p>
